And if you want to channel any of these adjectives, please go ahead. But for the purpose of clarity, here\u0026rsquo;s the three adjectives and the pitch for the city:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is \u003cstrong\u003estratified\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eclockwork\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ecanaled\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does this mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine that when people say time is a river, they mean it literally. Imagine the river of time was routed into canals that spread through a great city. Imagine this city as tall, built upon layers and layers of different communities and neighbourhoods. Imagine these canals entered the city at the very top and then slipped and flowed all the way down through the city\u0026rsquo;s many layers until it escaped and found its way into the sea of chaos. The river of time brings odd gifts and sometimes even odder things wash up on the shores of chaos. Some say the city is a giant water clock. But people who live there just call it home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the full list of adjectives:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStratified\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOccupied\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCanaled\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCrumbling\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHidden\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLooming\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eClockwork\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSundered\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTeetering\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProud\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAncient\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLabryinthe\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSnowbound\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeep-space\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExotic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDense\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVibrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAcademic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInterdimensional\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEthereal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGrowing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArtificial\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSolar\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlive\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVertical\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoriferous\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eColourful\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNostalgic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTechnomagical\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePolluted\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmpyreal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEroding\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnemoia\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBesieged\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOvershadowed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecular\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eElegiac\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInundated\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBeautiful\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSutainable\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","url":"/2022/12/21/setup-starting-adjectives/","image":"photos/<no value>","banner_image":"photos/<no value>","date_published":"21126-21-09T120:2121:00+00:00","date_modified":"21126-21-09T120:2121:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Indie RPG Newsletter","url":"https://ttrpg.substack.com"}}]}

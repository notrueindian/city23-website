The owner and operator of the Filthy Lilt is a bear of a man, but always has a smile on his face - unless you get on his bad side - and tries to greet every new patron that enters the Filthy Lilt. There are rumors that he has giant blood coursing through his veins and given his enormous size, you would likely agree. He can be occasionally seen lifting and moving an entire barrel of ale by himself, and stacking several full bags of grain on his shoulder to carry down to the mill room.</p><p>He prides himself on running a safe business and doesn&rsquo;t tolerate any fighting or other shenanigans from the patrons. He&rsquo;s been known to step in himself and toss a belligerent individual out the front door or even into the river if they are particularly violent.</p><p>For those that are simply there to enjoy themselves and eat a delicious meal, he is nothing but cordial and will happily partake in a conversation if he isn&rsquo;t too busy.</p><p>His family lives in the rooms at the back of the building above the kitchen&ndash;Elowen, his wife; Willow, his oldest daughter; Olive, the second oldest; and Juniper, the youngest; Aspen, his oldest son; and Cullen, his youngest. The girls share one room and the boys another. Everyone in the family are quite tall even for their individual ages, and are already getting their father&rsquo;s stout build.</p><p>The entire family works throughout the Filthy Lilt often changing roles from cook, to server, to butcher, to working in the mill downstairs. And, because they have no idea when a patron may show up, they work various shifts to ensure there is always someone awake and ready to attend to a patron or performer that stops by.</p><p>True name: Adair Calamaster</p><p>(From reader <a href=https://substack.com/profile/100223932-rob>Rob</a>)</p></div></main></body></html>

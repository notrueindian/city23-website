The mill and tavern sits securely at the river&rsquo;s edge. Its massive water wheel always spinning as the river passes by. Those on the other side of the river only ever hear the slow creaking of the turning wheel, and the noise from the massive building is only a barely audible murmur that sounds as if it is originating within the hearer&rsquo;s head rather than from the building across the water. Just as the smells of the various meals being prepared stir long forgotten fleeting memories with no real source.</p><p>Inside the tavern, there is always a musician, storyteller, or performer of some sort entertaining from the small stage positioned along the wall opposite the water wheel. It is rare for any given performer to appear with any regularity, but the guests are never wanting for some form of entertainment.</p><p>The various servers are always busy serving guests at all hours of the day. Every meal comes with a small loaf of freshly baked bread of whatever flavor happened to tickle the baker&rsquo;s fancy at the time. And the building itself is always surrounded by mouth watering smells that tug at the stomach of anyone that ventures close to it. Some guests stay the night, but most only come for a meal and a show before stepping outside and finding themselves back in Immoria at the point they had found their way into Tangent.</p><p>Behind the building-length bar is the kitchen and below is the great grain mill and the stores of raw grains waiting to be ground along with the finished flours and meals waiting to be transported to various customers around Tangent.</p><p>At the back of the kitchen is the door to the backyard with its numerous drying racks with curing meats, smokers and grills preparing various meats for the guests, and a modest sized garden with various vegetables used to supplement the imported vegetables that occasionally make it to the tavern.</p><p>Next to the door is a line of ovens used to keep the fresh loaves of bread in full supply.</p><p>A small staircase in the kitchen leads down to the mill as well as up to the home of the owner and his family.</p><p>Along the front wall of the main room is a small staircase that leads up to the handful of typically vacant guestrooms. Obviously built as an afterthought as the partially block some of the large windows that line the front of the building.</p><p>Neighborhood: Tangent</p><p>Address: At the river&rsquo;s edge and the end of Broadway.</p><p>True Name: It had a name once, but it has since been forgotten; although, when pressed the owner sometimes recalls it, but it is only a fleeting thought that stays stuck to the tip of his tongue.</p><p>(From reader <a href=https://substack.com/profile/100223932-rob>Rob</a>)</p></div></main></body></html>

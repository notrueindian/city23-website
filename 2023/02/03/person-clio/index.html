Her dark eyes having a “knowing” expression to them, and those that meet her all mention that they felt like she knew them before they uttered a word. She is always happy to talk to those that patronize her shop, and once the conversation turns to that of history, the corners of her lips break into a small smile that reaches all the way to her eyes. She always has a faint flowery scent about her that is simply pleasant without being overpowering or distracting. She walks with a steady and almost youthful stride as she shows her customers about her shop or walks them out to the Last Post to post their message. In the evening, once she has closed the shop, she can oftentimes be found at the Filthy Lilt listening to the stories of the performers on stage, and has been known to occasionally take a seat on stage to tell a story herself. She often accompanies her story with light strums from a lyre to punctuate her story, or provide a melody to help carry the feel of her story.</p><p>True name: One of the 9</p><p>Landmark: The Lost Post / Clio’s Stationer and Bookstore</p><p>(From reader <a href=https://substack.com/profile/100223932-rob>Rob</a>)</p></div></main></body></html>

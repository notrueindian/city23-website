Although they think of themselves more as a caretaker or shrine keeper. They spend their time at the cramped, little desk, furiously writing tiny descriptions with their ink pen. They are sixteen years old, skinny with a short frame. They sit before an open tome, scanning the pages for stories of the past. They listen to Saga’s and Clio’s stories with rapt enthusiasm, memorizing every little detail. They have brown, almond skin and usually wear a thick pair of white spectacles. And they have a gift: any little thing, even trash long forgotten, has a story nestled inside. It has made life hard for Noor. Touching any little thing throws them into a trance, envisioning the life of an object. From those who held and cherished it, to those who used it for terrible violence. Noor spends much of their time inside. Though they love the adventure of finding something new, their gift has costs. They like their indoor life, sharing it with any migrant who calls The Fore home, for a time. They have learned to master their gift, to touch a pen or a book without overwhelming their senses. Yet theirs is a quiet, slow-moving life. Yet Noor does fear one thing. In Immoria, transformation is a part of life. What happened to the past curator, the mysterious fellow who left all of these riches? Is Noor’s fate the same?</p><p>Landmark: The Fore</p><p>True Name: Seer of the Hands</p><p>(From reader <a href=https://substack.com/profile/9082016-ryan-z>Ryan</a>)</p></div></main></body></html>

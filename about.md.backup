This is the archive for the game of [*i'm sorry did you say street magic*](https://seaexcursion.itch.io/street-magic) being played by the readers of the [Indie RPG Newsletter](https://ttrpg.substack.com/). What does that mean? Basically, we're make up a imaginary city together. You can play along as well by subcribing and responding to the prompts sent every week in the newsletter comments. 

The home page lists the posts chronologically. The organized list page shows the posts categorized into neighbourhoods with their corresponding landmarks and residents listed beneath.

---------------

The rules are simple. Based on the prompt (called a compass) in the newsletter, readers contribute a neighbourhood, landmark or resident. 

To contribute a neighbourhood, you need to submit a name, a brief description and a true name.

To contribute a landmark, you need to submit a name, a brief description, a true name, and which neighbourhood it comes under.

To contribute a resident or person, you need a name, a brief description, a true name, and a landmark which they're connected to.

True names are poetic images or phrases that try to capture the essence of the thing. It's a nice part of the game. You can read [this entry](https://immoria.xyz/2023/01/21/landmark-cauldronshrine/) to get a sense of how it works.

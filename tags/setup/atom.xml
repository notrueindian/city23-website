One answer from reader, Aaron, reminded me about something important:
A city&amp;rsquo;s names - Nham Sin by the old pump-guard families down in the deep, Khim Sin-har by the brass lords of the upper strata, Turnwater by the traders of the night roads, Trickstream by the knaves of the dusklight eaves, Hanam by the records of the empire of the dead.</description></item><item><title>Setup: Starting Adjectives</title><link>/2022/12/21/setup-starting-adjectives/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/12/21/setup-starting-adjectives/</guid><description>For the first step of our i&amp;rsquo;m sorry did you say street magic, I asked folks to submit adjectives that will define our city.
The game&amp;rsquo;s rules say we need 3 adjectives - just enough to give us a sense of our city without it becoming a straitjacket. We want to discover the city as we play.
But we received more than 40 submissions! So I see my job as sieving through these submissions, seeing the emergent patterns, and picking the 3 adjectives that I think are most inspiring when combined together.</description></item></channel></rss>

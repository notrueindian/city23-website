      <description>For the first step of our i&amp;rsquo;m sorry did you say street magic, I asked folks to submit adjectives that will define our city.
The game&amp;rsquo;s rules say we need 3 adjectives - just enough to give us a sense of our city without it becoming a straitjacket. We want to discover the city as we play.
But we received 39 submissions! So I see my job as sieving through these submissions, seeing the emergent patterns, and picking the 3 adjectives that I think are most inspiring when combined together.</description>

Description: Also known as the Oak Tree, a nickname only spoken in private by the citizens of Tangent. The owner and operator of the Filthy Lilt is a bear of a man, but always has a smile on his face - unless you get on his bad side - and tries to greet every new patron that enters the Filthy Lilt. There are rumors that he has giant blood coursing through his veins and given his enormous size, you would likely agree.</description></item><item><title>Person: Mama Crowder</title><link>/2023/01/21/person-mama-crowder/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2023/01/21/person-mama-crowder/</guid><description>Landmark: Crowder&amp;rsquo;s Chowders
Description: The matron of Crowder&amp;rsquo;s Chowders, Mama Crowder is a treasure trove of knowledge about local history and fluvial patterns. If you need assistance navigating the river or the shadow politics of the Warrens, Mama can help â€” but her assistance comes at a cost. Don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you find yourself gunning for clams with the Crowder boys before sunrise.

&lt;p>Nobody in Bargetown knows who first abandoned the old iron cauldron. Nobody knows whether it had food in it to begin, or whether that food was placed inside as an afterthought. What the people of Bargetown do know is that one night, someone took some preserved fish from the cauldron, and the next week, they dropped into the cauldron a tin of jam. Someone else took that jam, and returned a loaf of bread; someone else took that bread, and returned a sack of peppers. Over time, people continued to take from the cauldron, and gave what they could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, Cauldronshrine is a thriving guerrilla food pantry, a place where people share what food they can offer. Smaller cauldrons are a frequent sight in Bargetown. They have begun popping up in other neighborhoods, to varying degrees of success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True name: The first of many open hands&lt;/p>

This assembly makes its way, every day, from the lowest points of the river all the way up through the windings paths and lochs, to the highest point it will fit. Behind it trail large nets in a constant sweeping wave of movement, pulling in and being thrown out, catching great hauls of fresh fish and other river delicacies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Flotilla is the source of much of the fish to Immoria, but also home to a small community all of its own. Sailors, fishers, chefs, preservers, and their families, all call it their permanent home. There&amp;rsquo;s restaurants on board for people who want either the very freshest catches, as well as auctions and markets for fish and stranger hauls. It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for fishers to pull out some undescribed animal, or a relic from somewhere or somewhen else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At night the Flotilla docks at the top of the river, waiting until dawn when it finds itself, through a convenient eddy in time, back at the river&amp;rsquo;s mouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True Name: The constant scrape of weighted nets against the riverbed, the harried cry of an auctioneer, the dread of creatures fleeing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Description: Also known as the Oak Tree, a nickname only spoken in private by the citizens of Tangent. The owner and operator of the Filthy Lilt is a bear of a man, but always has a smile on his face - unless you get on his bad side - and tries to greet every new patron that enters the Filthy Lilt. There are rumors that he has giant blood coursing through his veins and given his enormous size, you would likely agree. He can be occasionally seen lifting and moving an entire barrel of ale by himself, and stacking several full bags of grain on his shoulder to carry down to the mill room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He prides himself on running a safe business and doesn&amp;rsquo;t tolerate any fighting or other shenanigans from the patrons. He&amp;rsquo;s been known to step in himself and toss a belligerent individual out the front door or even into the river if they are particularly violent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those that are simply there to enjoy themselves and eat a delicious meal, he is nothing but cordial and will happily partake in a conversation if he isn&amp;rsquo;t too busy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His family lives in the rooms at the back of the building above the kitchen&amp;ndash;Elowen, his wife; Willow, his oldest daughter; Olive, the second oldest; and Juniper, the youngest; Aspen, his oldest son; and Cullen, his youngest. The girls share one room and the boys another. Everyone in the family are quite tall even for their individual ages, and are already getting their father&amp;rsquo;s stout build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The entire family works throughout the Filthy Lilt often changing roles from cook, to server, to butcher, to working in the mill downstairs. And, because they have no idea when a patron may show up, they work various shifts to ensure there is always someone awake and ready to attend to a patron or performer that stops by.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True name: Adair Calamaster&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Description: The matron of Crowder&amp;rsquo;s Chowders, Mama Crowder is a treasure trove of knowledge about local history and fluvial patterns. If you need assistance navigating the river or the shadow politics of the Warrens, Mama can help — but her assistance comes at a cost. Don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you find yourself gunning for clams with the Crowder boys before sunrise.&lt;/p>

The Crowder family has followed these shifting waterways for generations, plucking the freshest bivalves and trivalves from their sandy homes before they go from mollusk to dry husk. Mixed with hydroponically grown veggies and the city&amp;rsquo;s freshest cream, Crowder&amp;rsquo;s Chowders give even the couriers of Immoria&amp;rsquo;s wealthiest citizens reason to slum it in the Warrens until the ladle hits the bottom of the pot.&lt;/p>

Changing in name, appearance, menu, and smells throughout each day, this bakery is well-known for its delicious, lovingly crafted baked goods. Locals have learned which foods are available during which cycles and make sure to stop by as soon as cookies, cakes, pastries, breads, and more come out of the oven. Despite its popularity, there have been a few complaints about the crowds that tend to form outside when it is The Bake; people linger to enjoy the warmth radiating off the building and the delicious smells emanating from inside, even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t buying anything.&lt;/p>

The mill and tavern sits securely at the river&amp;rsquo;s edge. Its massive water wheel always spinning as the river passes by. Those on the other side of the river only ever hear the slow creaking of the turning wheel, and the noise from the massive building is only a barely audible murmur that sounds as if it is originating within the hearer&amp;rsquo;s head rather than from the building across the water. Just as the smells of the various meals being prepared stir long forgotten fleeting memories with no real source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inside the tavern, there is always a musician, storyteller, or performer of some sort entertaining from the small stage positioned along the wall opposite the water wheel. It is rare for any given performer to appear with any regularity, but the guests are never wanting for some form of entertainment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The various servers are always busy serving guests at all hours of the day. Every meal comes with a small loaf of freshly baked bread of whatever flavor happened to tickle the baker&amp;rsquo;s fancy at the time. And the building itself is always surrounded by mouth watering smells that tug at the stomach of anyone that ventures close to it. Some guests stay the night, but most only come for a meal and a show before stepping outside and finding themselves back in Immoria at the point they had found their way into Tangent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the building-length bar is the kitchen and below is the great grain mill and the stores of raw grains waiting to be ground along with the finished flours and meals waiting to be transported to various customers around Tangent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the back of the kitchen is the door to the backyard with its numerous drying racks with curing meats, smokers and grills preparing various meats for the guests, and a modest sized garden with various vegetables used to supplement the imported vegetables that occasionally make it to the tavern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next to the door is a line of ovens used to keep the fresh loaves of bread in full supply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A small staircase in the kitchen leads down to the mill as well as up to the home of the owner and his family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along the front wall of the main room is a small staircase that leads up to the handful of typically vacant guestrooms. Obviously built as an afterthought as the partially block some of the large windows that line the front of the building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neighborhood: Tangent&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Address: At the river&amp;rsquo;s edge and the end of Broadway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True Name: It had a name once, but it has since been forgotten; although, when pressed the owner sometimes recalls it, but it is only a fleeting thought that stays stuck to the tip of his tongue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The inventors of Brasspool are notorious for neglecting good habits in pursuit of their clockwork dreams. So, a health conscious inventor created the gong, a brass obelisk that when struck would send out ultrasonic waves reminding all it was time to eat. Unfortunately this works no matter how recently you have eaten, so it quickly became open to abuse by nefarious restauranteurs and muffin-wives. The watch have had to post a guard to keep troublemakers at bay and the vomitoria from over-use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neighbourhood: Brasspool&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Address: The gong is to be found in a sunken recess in the middle of an overgrown park, now neglected but once celebrating some sort of victory or event. This makes it hard to police as some cunning rascal is always sneaking past to start a new rush hour for the local food trucks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True name: The ache of salivation&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s only open when the sun isn&amp;rsquo;t up - and there are plenty of rumors about why - and so it caters to dockworkers, students, artists, artisans, and other people who tend to find their leisure in the dark hours. The beer is middling quality, middling price. But the food! The food is exquisite. People say it&amp;rsquo;s the only place to get something that tastes like home, wherever your home might be. Somehow biting into one of the buns makes you think of your grandma, the one you liked, even if she never made a bun in her life. The kitchen is wreathed in secrecy, and the proprietor keeps it tightly locked most of the time, only adding to the mystery of how they make food that tastes exactly like you need it to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neighborhood: Brasspool&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Address: A modestly sized pub, tucked in a side street just off a main drag. Not hard to find if you know what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t catch the eye.&lt;/p>

These farms provide bushels of wholesome, flavorful mushrooms to the central neighborhood Spore Market. But in the odder corners of the Warrens, under the influence of entombed, anachronistic relics, less wholesome, but far more interesting, fungi are available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The true name of the Spore Market lies in the smell of damp earth, and the irrepressible love of life found in the people of the Warrens.&lt;/p>

Here also are the rows of brick tenements housing metal workers, carpenters, and sail makers who give solid shape to innovation with their labor.&lt;/p>

Looking at the neighborhood from higher levels there doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any route into Tangent, yet people tend to find their way there, but only if they are merely wondering within the city. Once there, they always find something to do. The neighborhood is absolutely bustling with activity, but upon finishing the task they found themselves focused on upon entering, just a few steps later they find themselves back at the place they were last at outside of Tangent. Interestingly, it appears that no time will have passed between leaving and returning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those that live in Tangent were those that had no real home or job within the city when they entered, but find life in Tangent perfect for themselves. There are always lots of customers for their shops, and plenty of down time as well to enjoy many of the entertainment venues scattered around Tangent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No one really knows when Tangent was started, or by whom. The oldest families in the city tell the same story&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s always been there.&lt;/p>

One answer from reader, Aaron, reminded me about something important:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A city&amp;rsquo;s names - Nham Sin by the old pump-guard families down in the deep, Khim Sin-har by the brass lords of the upper strata, Turnwater by the traders of the night roads, Trickstream by the knaves of the dusklight eaves, Hanam by the records of the empire of the dead.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Our city has got many names! Obviously! And in some sense, the more names the better. But we still needed to pick one name for a couple reasons. One, because there is probably an official name for the city and two, the more important reason, so it’s easy for us to refer to the city without being confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I put out a shortlist of 5 and took a vote (Substack limits polls to 5 choices, there were other great ones).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Delta&lt;/strong>, a great name from reader Alex that is “both the landmass that forms at the mouth of a river as it meets the sea and the symbol for change over time”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Clepsydra&lt;/strong>, from Charles is Greek for water clock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Chronourcleftis&lt;/strong>, from Ron which sorta means “thief of time” in Greek.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Clog Uisce,&lt;/strong> from Boyd, which is Irish Gaelic for water clock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Immoria&lt;/strong>, from Preston.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And the winner of the poll was&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Immoria!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking forward to building out the city of Immoria together.&lt;/p></description><author>Indie RPG Newsletter</author><guid>/2022/12/29/setup-names/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Setup: Starting Adjectives</title><link>/2022/12/21/setup-starting-adjectives/</link><description>&lt;p>For the first step of our &lt;em>i&amp;rsquo;m sorry did you say street magic&lt;/em>, I asked folks to submit adjectives that will define our city.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The game&amp;rsquo;s rules say we need 3 adjectives - just enough to give us a sense of our city without it becoming a straitjacket. We want to discover the city as we play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we received more than 40 submissions! So I see my job as sieving through these submissions, seeing the emergent patterns, and picking the 3 adjectives that I think are most inspiring when combined together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What patterns did I see? People are seeing a city that is ancient, crumbling, eroding, maybe even sundered or inundated. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is vertical, looming, labryinthine. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is stratified but dense, vibrant, colourful, proud, beautiful. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing something interdimensional, artificial, technomagical. Maybe its sustainable, solar, growing, or potentially alive. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is hidden or snowbound. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is under threat - besieged or occuppied or teetering on the edge of some other disaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a lot - and a city can be all of these things. And if you want to channel any of these adjectives, please go ahead. But for the purpose of clarity, here&amp;rsquo;s the three adjectives and the pitch for the city:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is &lt;strong>stratified&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>clockwork&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>canaled&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does this mean?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine that when people say time is a river, they mean it literally. Imagine the river of time was routed into canals that spread through a great city. Imagine this city as tall, built upon layers and layers of different communities and neighbourhoods. Imagine these canals entered the city at the very top and then slipped and flowed all the way down through the city&amp;rsquo;s many layers until it escaped and found its way into the sea of chaos. The river of time brings odd gifts and sometimes even odder things wash up on the shores of chaos. Some say the city is a giant water clock. But people who live there just call it home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the full list of adjectives:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stratified&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Occupied&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Canaled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Crumbling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hidden&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Looming&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clockwork&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sundered&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teetering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proud&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ancient&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Labryinthe&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Snowbound&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deep-space&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exotic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dense&lt;/li>

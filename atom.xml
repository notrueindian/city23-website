      <title>Neighborhood: Bargetown</title>
      <link>/posts/neighbourhood-bargetown/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A teeming and fetid favela of hundreds of rotting barges, tied together. Houses, shops, taverns and hulks all intertwined. A place of first refuge for migrants and those fleeing from the law, or many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Name: The Holds: Where the real rulers of Bargetown reside, often in hidden splendour. Only emerging at night to go about their business&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neighborhood: Brasspool</title>
      <link>/posts/neighbourhood-brasspool/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Near the docks of the city you find the shipyards, workshops, and foundries of Brasspool. Here artisans, inventors, and engineers craft exotic airships, yachts, and submersibles for wealthy citizens, bold adventurers, and curious scientists. Here also are the rows of brick tenements housing metal workers, carpenters, and sail makers who give solid shape to innovation with their labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret name of Brasspool is found in the ceaseless clangor of metal on metal and the susurrus of the canals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neighborhood: Tangent</title>
      <link>/posts/neighbourhood-tangent/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood sits right next to the river and to one side on its own level. Looking at the neighborhood from higher levels there doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any route into Tangent, yet people tend to find their way there, but only if they are merely wondering within the city. Once there, they always find something to do. The neighborhood is absolutely bustling with activity, but upon finishing the task they found themselves focused on upon entering, just a few steps later they find themselves back at the place they were last at outside of Tangent. Interestingly, it appears that no time will have passed between leaving and returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that live in Tangent were those that had no real home or job within the city when they entered, but find life in Tangent perfect for themselves. There are always lots of customers for their shops, and plenty of down time as well to enjoy many of the entertainment venues scattered around Tangent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one really knows when Tangent was started, or by whom. The oldest families in the city tell the same story&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s always been there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this neighbourhood the streams of time have formed a whirlpool, and the area exists in a cyclical state, rotating through different functions/styles throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neighborhood: The Warrens</title>
      <link>/posts/neighbourhood-warrens/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New construction, natural erosion, magical interference, for whatever reason sometimes the river of time shifts its course, leaving dry or damp canal beds empty. This network of ditches and tunnels has become home to the poor and downtrodden of the city. Digging their homes and businesses into the sides of the canals the often unearthed treasures of the past and future, though most of what was there to find has long been ecscavated. These peculiar anachronism, when too complicated or large to be sold to or stolen by the city&amp;rsquo;s elites have become part of the architechture of the Warrens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True name: Deep Burroughs, shadowed anachronism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>/posts/neighbourhood-wwtz/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WWTZ or Waste Water Treatment Zone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools and pipes. The mingling smells of sewage and sterility. Uniformed workers in hard hats, goggles, and rubber waders. Takes in brown water and makes it gray. Steam jets, winding paths, man-made fog. Pools of red and yellow light cast from safety instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True name: The Sieve&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setup: Names</title>
      <link>/posts/setup-names/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I asked readers for suggestions of names and we get some really interesting ones. One answer from reader, Aaron, reminded me about something important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A city&amp;rsquo;s names - Nham Sin by the old pump-guard families down in the deep, Khim Sin-har by the brass lords of the upper strata, Turnwater by the traders of the night roads, Trickstream by the knaves of the dusklight eaves, Hanam by the records of the empire of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our city has got many names! Obviously! And in some sense, the more names the better. But we still needed to pick one name for a couple reasons. One, because there is probably an official name for the city and two, the more important reason, so it’s easy for us to refer to the city without being confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put out a shortlist of 5 and took a vote (Substack limits polls to 5 choices, there were other great ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta&lt;/strong&gt;, a great name from reader Alex that is “both the landmass that forms at the mouth of a river as it meets the sea and the symbol for change over time”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clepsydra&lt;/strong&gt;, from Charles is Greek for water clock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronourcleftis&lt;/strong&gt;, from Ron which sorta means “thief of time” in Greek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clog Uisce,&lt;/strong&gt; from Boyd, which is Irish Gaelic for water clock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immoria&lt;/strong&gt;, from Preston.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the winner of the poll was&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;Immoria!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to building out the city of Immoria together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setup: Starting Adjectives</title>
      <link>/posts/setup-starting-adjectives/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first step of our &lt;em&gt;i&amp;rsquo;m sorry did you say street magic&lt;/em&gt;, I asked folks to submit adjectives that will define our city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s rules say we need 3 adjectives - just enough to give us a sense of our city without it becoming a straitjacket. We want to discover the city as we play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we received more than 40 submissions! So I see my job as sieving through these submissions, seeing the emergent patterns, and picking the 3 adjectives that I think are most inspiring when combined together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What patterns did I see? People are seeing a city that is ancient, crumbling, eroding, maybe even sundered or inundated. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is vertical, looming, labryinthine. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is stratified but dense, vibrant, colourful, proud, beautiful. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing something interdimensional, artificial, technomagical. Maybe its sustainable, solar, growing, or potentially alive. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is hidden or snowbound. They&amp;rsquo;re seeing a city that is under threat - besieged or occuppied or teetering on the edge of some other disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot - and a city can be all of these things. And if you want to channel any of these adjectives, please go ahead. But for the purpose of clarity, here&amp;rsquo;s the three adjectives and the pitch for the city:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;stratified&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;clockwork&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;canaled&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that when people say time is a river, they mean it literally. Imagine the river of time was routed into canals that spread through a great city. Imagine this city as tall, built upon layers and layers of different communities and neighbourhoods. Imagine these canals entered the city at the very top and then slipped and flowed all the way down through the city&amp;rsquo;s many layers until it escaped and found its way into the sea of chaos. The river of time brings odd gifts and sometimes even odder things wash up on the shores of chaos. Some say the city is a giant water clock. But people who live there just call it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the full list of adjectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stratified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occupied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canaled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crumbling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clockwork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sundered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teetering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ancient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labryinthe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snowbound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep-space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vibrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Academic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interdimensional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethereal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artificial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odoriferous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colourful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nostalgic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technomagical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polluted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empyreal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eroding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anemoia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besieged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overshadowed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elegiac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inundated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sutainable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

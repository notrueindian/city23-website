I asked readers for suggestions of names and we get some really interesting ones. One answer from reader, Aaron, reminded me about something important:

A city's names - Nham Sin by the old pump-guard families down in the deep, Khim Sin-har by the brass lords of the upper strata, Turnwater by the traders of the night roads, Trickstream by the knaves of the dusklight eaves, Hanam by the records of the empire of the dead. 

> Our city has got many names! Obviously! And in some sense, the more names the better. But we still needed to pick one name for a couple reasons. One, because there is probably an official name for the city and two, the more important reason, so it’s easy for us to refer to the city without being confused. 

So I put out a shortlist of 5 and took a vote (Substack limits polls to 5 choices, there were other great ones). 

+ **Delta**, a great name from reader Alex that is “both the landmass that forms at the mouth of a river as it meets the sea and the symbol for change over time”. 
+ **Clepsydra**, from Charles is Greek for water clock. 
+ **Chronourcleftis**, from Ron which sorta means “thief of time” in Greek. 
+ **Clog Uisce,** from Boyd, which is Irish Gaelic for water clock. 
+ **Immoria**, from Preston. 

And the winner of the poll was... **Immoria!** 

Looking forward to building out the city of Immoria together.
